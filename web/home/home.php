  <p>Hi, I’m Melissa Hull. I’m currently studying my last semester at Brigham Young University-Idaho. My major is
    Professional Studies with an emphasis in Web Development and Family History Research. Front-end development is my
    passion and with my vast knowledge of server-side programming, I have a notable ability to communicate with the
    back-end as well. I work well on my own but I thrive in a team environment and do my best work by breaking down
    problems to solve them. Being a Home Engineer for over ten years, I have the ability to work under pressure and have
    remarkable scheduling and organizational skills. I’d really love to work for you.</p>
