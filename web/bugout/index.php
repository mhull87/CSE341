  <h2>Welcome to Bug Out Survival</h2>

  <p class="padding">If you ever find yourself in a situation where you need to leave fast, a bug out bag is essential for survival. We provide you a way to plan for emergency evacuation. There is a list of items in the Survival Essentails tab that will help you pack your bug out bag for any emergency that may come your way.</p>
  <p class="padding">Bags are small and cannot fit it all. You can also make a list of extra items to stash away if you have time to get them when you leave.</p>
  <p class="padding">To start, create an account or login. Then look through the Survival Essentials and make a list of what you need. In the My Gear tab you can add items to your bug out bag and add items to an extras list.</p>
